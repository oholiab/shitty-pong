Shitty JRuby pong clone from the tutorial at
http://www.rubyinside.com/video-game-ruby-tutorial-5726.html with a few minor
modifications of my own and a couple of fixes for things that didn't work. Just
to try out making games in JRuby.

This is terrible code - it is used only as a POC and should not be considered
indicitive of my coding standards!
